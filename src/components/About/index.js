      <p>
        I'm a software engineer with experience in
        engineering sales and a degree in Biological 
        Engineering. After deciding to transition into software
        development, I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp.
        Currently, I am working as the sole developer at a small
        manufacturing start-up.
