        <p>
          I'm a software engineer with experience in
          engineering sales and a degree in Biological 
          Engineering. After deciding to transition into software
          development, I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp.
          Currently, I am working as the sole developer at a small
          manufacturing start-up.
